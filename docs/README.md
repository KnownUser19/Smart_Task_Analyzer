# Screenshots Folder

Add your application screenshots here to display in the README.

## Recommended Screenshots:
1. `demo-screenshot.png` - Main application view (referenced in README)
2. `form-input.png` - Task input form
3. `analysis-results.png` - Analysis results view
4. `recommendations.png` - Top 3 recommendations modal

## How to Take Good Screenshots:
1. Use a clean browser window (no bookmarks bar)
2. Use the dark theme (default)
3. Add 3-5 sample tasks for context
4. Capture at 1280x800 or higher resolution
5. Use PNG format for best quality

## Quick Tip:
You can use browser extensions like "Full Page Screen Capture" or built-in 
developer tools (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Capture full size screenshot") to get 
clean, complete screenshots.
